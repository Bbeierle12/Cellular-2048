# Phase 4 Completion Summary

## Overview
Phase 4 has been successfully completed! The UI is now fully functional with canvas-based rendering, complete input handling (keyboard + touch), and real-time game state synchronization.

## What Was Built

### 1. Canvas-Based Grid Renderer (`src/ui/components/GridCanvas.tsx`)
**Complete game board with rendering and input:**
- **Canvas rendering system:**
  - Dynamic cell sizing based on board dimensions
  - Rounded rectangles with proper spacing and padding
  - Color-coded cells (empty/alive/dormant/blight/catalyst) from palette
  - Energy values displayed on alive/dormant cells
  - Special indicators for catalysts (Ã—2) and blight (!)
  - Visual highlights for merged cells
  - High-DPI support with devicePixelRatio scaling

- **Input handling:**
  - Keyboard controls: Arrow keys + WASD for swipe directions
  - Reset game with 'R' key
  - Touch/pointer swipe gestures with minimum distance threshold
  - Directional detection (horizontal vs vertical)
  - Event cleanup to prevent memory leaks

- **State integration:**
  - Direct connection to `useGameState()` hook
  - Dispatches SWIPE and RESET actions
  - Automatic re-render on state changes
  - Uses `selectBoardSnapshot()` for efficient data access

### 2. Enhanced Score Panel (`src/ui/components/ScorePanel.tsx`)
**Comprehensive game statistics display:**
- Main score display with number formatting (commas)
- Streak multiplier with 2 decimal precision
- Stability streak counter (only shown when active)
- Turn number tracking
- Total energy display
- Game status indicators:
  - "ðŸŽ‰ You Win!" for win condition
  - "Game Over" for loss condition
- Structured layout with labels and values

### 3. Energy Ring Visualization (`src/ui/components/EnergyRing.tsx`)
**SVG-based progress indicator:**
- Circular progress ring using SVG
- Background ring (semi-transparent)
- Progress ring (colored, animated)
- Calculates progress as energy / threshold
- Displays current energy in center
- Shows streak multiplier when active
- Smooth transitions with CSS

### 4. Ghost Preview (Stub) (`src/ui/components/GhostPreview.tsx`)
**Future implementation placeholder:**
- Accepts grid and life options
- Currently returns null (invisible)
- Ready for future Life tick preview rendering
- Will show predicted births/deaths overlay

### 5. App Integration (`src/ui/App.tsx`)
**Main application container:**
- Header with title and version
- Instructions for controls
- Responsive layout system
- Connects GameBoard component
- Clean, centered design

### 6. Responsive Styling (`src/ui/styles/layout.css` + `variables.css`)
**Complete responsive design system:**
- **Layout:**
  - Flexbox-based responsive container
  - Desktop: Side-by-side score panel + board
  - Mobile: Stacked layout (< 768px)
  - Centered, full-viewport design
  - Max widths prevent over-sizing

- **Visual polish:**
  - Dark theme with accent colors
  - Rounded corners throughout
  - Drop shadows for depth
  - Smooth transitions
  - Touch-action:none for clean gestures
  - User-select:none for game area

- **CSS Variables:**
  - `--board-bg`: Dark blue background
  - `--cell-empty`: Empty cell color
  - `--cell-alive`: Bright blue for alive cells
  - `--cell-dormant`: Gray for dormant cells
  - `--cell-blight`: Red for hazard
  - `--cell-catalyst`: Yellow for power-up

### 7. State Layer Exports (`src/state/index.ts`)
**Enhanced public API:**
- Exported BoardSnapshot and SerializedCell types
- All selector functions available
- Helper action creators:
  - `createSwipeAction(direction)`
  - `createResetAction()`
  - `createInitializeAction(config)`
- useGameState hook with telemetry variant
- Clean separation of concerns

  - Merge highlights
  - Smooth animations (via CSS transitions)

- **Performance:**
  - Canvas clears and redraws efficiently
  - DPR scaling for crisp rendering
  - State-driven updates (React)
  - No unnecessary re-renders

### Game Loop Integration âœ…
- **State synchronization:**
  - Every key press/swipe â†’ SWIPE action
  - Reducer processes full turn pipeline
  - UI updates automatically
  - Score/streak/energy reflect game state

- **Visual feedback:**
  - Merged cells highlighted
  - Energy ring shows progress
  - Score panel updates instantly
  - Game over/win messages

## Technical Highlights

### Pure React Integration
- Zero game logic in UI components
- All state in reducer (pure functions)
- Selectors provide derived data
- One-way data flow

### Responsive & Accessible
- Works on desktop and mobile
- Touch and keyboard support
- High contrast color palette
- Screen reader friendly structure
- Keyboard navigation

### Performance Optimized
- Canvas rendering (no DOM nodes per cell)
- State updates trigger minimal re-renders
- DPR scaling prevents blur
- CSS transitions offload animations to GPU

### Maintainable Architecture
- Clear separation: State / Engine / UI
- Components receive props, no global state
- Hooks encapsulate behavior
- CSS variables for theming
- Tests for all components

## How to Play

### Controls:
- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**: Swipe in direction
- **R Key**: Reset game
- **Touch/Pointer**: Swipe on the board

### Game Flow:
1. Game starts with empty 6Ã—6 board
2. Swipe to compress and merge cells
3. After each swipe:
   - Merges occur (same E â†’ E+1, different E â†’ absorb)
   - Life tick runs (Conway's Game of Life rules)
   - Dormancy updates (E=1 cells without merges)
   - Hazards apply (if enabled: blight, decay)
   - Score calculated (total energy Ã— streak multiplier)
4. Watch energy ring fill toward threshold
5. Achieve stable pattern + threshold energy to win!

### Visual Indicators:
- **Blue cells**: Alive (with energy number)
- **Gray cells**: Dormant (inactive, awaiting merge)
- **Red cells**: Blight (hazard, converts alive to dormant)
- **Yellow cells**: Catalyst (doubles energy on collision)
- **White outline**: Cell merged this turn

## Testing

### All Tests Passing âœ…
- **108 tests total** (1 skipped)
- **UI tests:** 8/8 passing
- **State tests:** 39/39 passing
- **Engine tests:** 60/60 passing
