# Turn Event Order

Canonical ordering for each player turn, covering swipe resolution, life tick, dormancy, blight/decay, and scoring. Summaries mirror docs/PLAN.md v1 spec and await detailed examples.

Sections to drafting:
1. Swipe compression and deterministic merge policy.
2. Catalyst intersections.
3. Life tick evaluation rules.
4. Dormancy counter updates.
5. Blight and decay hooks.
6. Scoring and streak multipliers.
