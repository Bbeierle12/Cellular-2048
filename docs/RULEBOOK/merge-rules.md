# Merge Rules

Documentation target for all swipe-time merge semantics including same-level merges, unequal absorption, dormant reactivation, and colony bonuses.

Open todo list:
- Capture deterministic tie-breaking along swipe direction.
- Define merge eligibility after a cell has merged once.
- Illustrate colony bonus trigger grids.
- Specify catalyst handling when merges happen concurrently.
