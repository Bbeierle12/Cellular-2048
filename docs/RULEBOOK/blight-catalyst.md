# Blight & Catalyst Systems

Holds exact spawning logic, shielding simulations, and catalyst doubling semantics.

## Blight
- Specify spawn cadence, linger duration, and telegraphing.
- Detail shielding algorithm using local simulation.
- Enumerate interactions with dormancy and decay.

## Catalysts
- Define seeded RNG distribution and concurrent cap.
- Clarify path intersection rules during swipe compression.
- Outline tuning knobs for double-energy caps.
