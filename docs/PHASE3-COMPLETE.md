# Phase 3 Completion Summary

## Overview
Phase 3 has been successfully completed! The game state management system is now fully implemented with a pure, deterministic reducer that orchestrates the complete turn sequence.

## What Was Built

### 1. Type System (`src/state/types.ts`)
- **DifficultyConfig**: Interface for difficulty settings loaded from JSON
- **TurnMetrics**: Comprehensive telemetry tracking for each turn
- **SerializedCell & BoardSnapshot**: UI-friendly board representation
- **GameState**: Complete state shape including:
  - Grid (board state)
  - Score and streak tracking
  - Turn number and game status (over/won)
  - Difficulty and feature flags
  - RNG seed and call count (for determinism)
  - Telemetry metrics history
- **GameAction**: Union type for all dispatachable actions (SWIPE, RESET, INITIALIZE, UPDATE_FLAGS)

### 2. Engine Configuration (`src/state/engine-config.ts`)
- **buildEngineConfig()**: Converts difficulty config + feature flags into engine-ready configuration
- Maps difficulty settings to:
  - Life tick options (birth rules, survival rules)
  - Dormancy config (threshold for conversion)
  - Decay config (isolation penalty)
  - Blight spawn config (spawn chance, linger duration, max tokens)
  - Catalyst spawn config (spawn chance, max count)
- **loadDifficulty()**: Async function to load difficulty JSON files dynamically

### 3. Board Serialization (`src/state/board-serializer.ts`)
- **serializeBoard()**: Converts Grid to flat BoardSnapshot with cell counts
- **serializeCell()**: Converts engine Cell to UI-friendly SerializedCell
- **calculateTotalEnergy()**: Sums all alive cell energy on board
- **isGameOver()**: Checks if no empty cells remain
- **checkWinCondition()**: Validates win state (stable + energy threshold)

### 4. Game Reducer (`src/state/reducers.ts`)
- **createInitialState()**: Pure function to create initial game state from config
- **gameReducer()**: Main pure reducer handling all actions
- **executeSwipeTurn()**: Orchestrates full turn pipeline:
  1. Map compass direction (N/E/S/W) to engine direction (up/down/left/right)
  2. Build engine config from difficulty + flags
  3. Create RNG from seed + call count
  4. Execute full turn via `executeTurn()`:
     - Swipe phase (with merges and catalyst collisions)
     - Life tick (Conway's GoL with births/deaths)
     - Dormancy update (E=1 cells without merges)
     - Hazards (blight conversion, isolation decay)
     - Scoring (energy tally + streak multiplier)
  5. Calculate total energy and game status
  6. Create turn metrics for telemetry
  7. Return updated state with metrics

### 5. Selectors (`src/state/selectors.ts`)
**Basic selectors:**
- selectScore, selectMultiplier, selectStreak
- selectTurnNumber, selectTotalEnergy
- selectIsGameOver, selectHasWon

**Board data:**
- selectBoardSnapshot (full serialized board)
- selectDifficulty, selectFeatureFlags
- selectBoardSize, selectEnergyCap

**Telemetry:**
- selectMetrics (all turn history)
- selectLastTurnMetrics (most recent turn)

**Aggregate statistics:**
- selectAverageEnergy
- selectBoardOccupancy
- selectProgressToWin

### 6. Hooks & API (`src/state/index.ts`)
- **useGameState()**: React hook providing [state, dispatch]
- **useGameStateWithTelemetry()**: Hook variant with automatic telemetry emission
- **Helper action creators:**
  - createSwipeAction()
  - createResetAction()
  - createInitializeAction()

## Tests Written

### Reducer Tests (`tests/state/reducers.spec.ts`) - 14 tests
- ✅ Initial state creation with config
- ✅ Board size override handling
- ✅ Random seed generation
- ✅ INITIALIZE action (reinit with new config)
- ✅ RESET action (new game with same difficulty)
- ✅ UPDATE_FLAGS action (runtime flag changes)
- ✅ SWIPE action execution and validation
- ✅ No-op when nothing moved
- ✅ No moves when game over/won
- ✅ Turn number increment
- ✅ RNG call count increment
- ✅ Telemetry tracking
- ✅ Full turn sequence integration

### Selector Tests (`tests/state/selectors.spec.ts`) - 22 tests
- ✅ All basic selectors
- ✅ Board snapshot serialization
- ✅ Cell counting (alive, dormant, blight, catalyst)
- ✅ Cell position serialization
- ✅ Configuration selectors
- ✅ Telemetry selectors
- ✅ Average energy calculation
- ✅ Board occupancy calculation
- ✅ Progress to win calculation

### Hook Tests (`tests/state/useGameState.spec.tsx`) - 3 tests
- ✅ Default initialization
- ✅ Swipe action dispatch
- ✅ Reset action dispatch

**Total: 39 tests, all passing ✅**

## Architecture Highlights

### Pure & Deterministic
- All state updates are pure functions
- RNG is seeded and tracked via call count
- Same seed + actions = same outcome (perfect for replay/debugging)

### Separation of Concerns
- Engine does game logic (turn.ts)
- State layer does orchestration + UI preparation
- Selectors provide computed/derived data

### Telemetry Integration
- Every turn automatically tracked
- Metrics include: births, deaths, merges, energy, streaks, hazards
- Can be sent to analytics sink via useGameStateWithTelemetry

### Feature Flag Support
- Runtime toggles for blight, catalysts, decay
- Engine config rebuilt on flag change
- No engine code modification needed

## API Usage Example

```typescript
// Initialize game
const [state, dispatch] = useGameState({
  difficulty: earlyDifficulty,
  featureFlags: { blight: false, catalysts: true, decay: false },
  seed: 12345
});

// Make a move
dispatch(createSwipeAction("E")); // Swipe right

// Read state
const score = selectScore(state);
const board = selectBoardSnapshot(state);
const energy = selectTotalEnergy(state);

// Reset game
dispatch(createResetAction());

// Toggle features
dispatch({ type: "UPDATE_FLAGS", flags: { blight: true } });
```

## Next Steps (Phase 4)
With Phase 3 complete, the state management system is ready to power the UI. Phase 4 will:
1. Replace placeholder UI components
2. Connect useGameState to the canvas renderer
3. Implement ghost preview (showing next Life tick)
4. Build energy ring visuals
5. Connect swipe/keyboard/touch input
6. Wire up the score panel
